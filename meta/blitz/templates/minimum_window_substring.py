# Test Case 1: Basic example with repeated characters
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
# Expected Output: "BANC"

# Test Case 2: Single character match
s = "a"
t = "a"
# Expected Output: "a"

# Test Case 3: No valid window
s = "a"
t = "aa"
# Expected Output: ""

# Test Case 4: Case-sensitive characters
s = "aA"
t = "Aa"
# Expected Output: "aA"

# Test Case 5: Window in the middle
s = "thisisateststring"
t = "tist"
# Expected Output: "tstri"

# Test Case 6: Long s, short t
s = "aaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbcdd"
t = "abcdd"
# Expected Output: "abbbbbcdd"

# Test Case 7: No overlap
s = "xyz"
t = "a"
# Expected Output: ""

# Test Case 8: t has duplicates that must be matched
s = "aaabdabcefaecbef"
t = "abcde"
# Expected Output: "abcefaec"

# Test Case 9: All characters are at the end
s = "xyzabc"
t = "abc"
# Expected Output: "abc"
