class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        pass

# Test Case 1
order = "cba"
s = "abcd"
# Output: "cbad", "cbda", "cdba", etc.
# Explanation: "c", "b", and "a" must appear in the order "c", "b", "a". "d" can go anywhere.

# Test Case 2
order = "bcafg"
s = "abcd"
# Output: "bcad", "bcda", "dbca", etc.
# "b", "c", "a" follow "b", "c", "a" order. "d" can be placed anywhere.

# Test Case 3
order = "xyz"
s = "abcdef"
# Output: Any permutation of "abcdef", since none of the characters in `order` are in `s`.

# Test Case 4
order = "abc"
s = "cccbbbaaa"
# Output: "aaabbbccc"
# Explanation: All characters are in `order` and should follow that exact sequence.

# Test Case 5
order = "hgfedcba"
s = "abcdefgh"
# Output: "hgfedcba"
# Explanation: Reverse sorted based on custom order

# Test Case 6
order = "abc"
s = ""
# Output: ""
# Explanation: Empty input string remains empty

# Test Case 7
order = "zxy"
s = "xyzxyz"
# Output: "zzyyxx"
# Explanation: "z" comes first, then "x", then "y" in custom order
